                        Life is the least system that we are aware about.We are amateur when it comes to dealing with life.
                        It has received plenty of characters though; no one is enlighened with complete knowledge.

                           Life is a race.Life is stage.Life is a journey.Life is mystery.Those are the common phrases those we 
                           daily strike on our head by inner wolf or surrounding wolf. Let's take life as a race for sometime.
                           We are bound to the society where achieving something really does matters to our success. To do something
                           admirable , worthy and adorable we have to compete and win . Exams are carried out to differentiate one another.In every 
                           sports , there is a winner in final round.There is no place for equality.In order to get placement in a company
                           we have to stand forward by tackling others down. Even our life has been formed on the basis of race with
                           pacing rapidly than other millions of sperms.
